.SYNOPSIS
    Validates canonical plugin README quality before commit

.DESCRIPTION
    Checks plugin READMEs in .github/plugins/*/README.md for:
    - Minimum content length (detects thin/stub content)
    - Required sections for published marketplace plugins
    - Prevents shipping incomplete plugin documentation

    This gate catches thin canonical READMEs before they are published.

.EXAMPLE
    .\check-plugin-readmes.ps1

.NOTES
    Part of pre-commit validation. Added after v1.8.44 to prevent
    shipping stub plugin READMEs to marketplace.
