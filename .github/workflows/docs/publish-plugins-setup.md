# Phase 3: GitHub Copilot Plugin Publishing

## Overview

PowerPointMcp plugins are published to the official GitHub Copilot CLI marketplace via a separate published marketplace repository. This document explains the maintainer-side workflow for automatic plugin republishing.

**Architecture:**
- **Source repo** (`sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint`) — Development, releases, skills, and canonical plugin templates
- **Published repo** (`sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint-plugins`) — Official marketplace artifacts
- **Two plugins:** `powerpoint-mcp` and `powerpoint-cli`, both published as wrapper/bootstrap bundles plus skills
- **Auto-sync:** `.github/workflows/publish-plugins.yml` builds and validates templates after each release

**Trigger:** After "Release All Components" workflow completes successfully, the publish workflow automatically syncs plugin artifacts to the marketplace.

**User Impact:** GitHub Copilot CLI users can install both plugins via `copilot plugin install`.

**Key Design:**
- Canonical Agent Plugins 1.0 templates live under `.github/plugins/` in the source repo
- The published repo is output-only and cannot feed legacy manifests back into future builds
- Version and current Agent Skills content are injected and validated during the publish workflow

See [GitHub Copilot Plugin Distribution](../../../docs/COPILOT-PLUGIN-DISTRIBUTION.md) for the user-facing documentation.

## What can be automated from this environment?

- **Token creation:** **No** — you must create a PAT or obtain an app token outside this workflow and store it as a repository secret.
- **Source-repo wiring with the token:** **Yes** — store the secret with `gh`.
- **Workflow readiness checks:** **Yes** — this repo already contains a preflight gate in `publish-plugins.yml` that fails fast if the secret is missing or the published repo is unreachable.

### CLI command to store the token

```powershell
# Store the PAT or app token as a repository secret in the source repo
gh secret set PLUGINS_REPO_TOKEN --repo sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint --body "<token-value>"
```

### Validate the repo-side wiring

```powershell
# Confirm the secret name exists (GitHub never returns the secret value)
gh secret list -R sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint
```

---

## Required Repository Secret

The workflow needs write access to the published repository. Store a token in the source repo:

### Token Setup (Required)

Choose **one** of these options:

#### Option A: Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
3. **Token name:** `PowerPointMcp Plugin Publisher`
4. **Expiration:** 90 days (recommended; rotate every 90 days or manually when workflow fails)
5. **Scopes:** Select `public_repo` (minimum scope for publishing to a public repo)
6. Click **Generate token** and copy the token value
7. Store it in the source repo:
   ```powershell
   gh secret set PLUGINS_REPO_TOKEN --repo sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint --body "<token-value>"
   ```

#### Option B: GitHub App Token

If you've already created a GitHub App for other purposes:
1. Generate a temporary app installation token from the app's settings
2. Store it as `PLUGINS_REPO_TOKEN` (same as above)

### Why Stored Token?

- ✅ Simple setup — one secret, no extra variables
- ✅ Works immediately — no browser-based app creation or installation flow
- ✅ Easy to rotate — update the secret when needed
- ✅ Same behavior as the legacy PAT approach

---

## Workflow Behavior

### Trigger Conditions
- ✅ Runs ONLY when "Release All Components" workflow completes successfully
- ✅ Runs ONLY on `main` branch releases
- ✅ Maintainers also get a manual re-sync entry point for repair/replay scenarios
- ❌ Does NOT run on failed releases
- ❌ Does NOT run on PR builds or test runs

### What It Does

1. **Resolve Tag + Version** — Extracts version from the triggering workflow's HEAD commit tag, or validates the manually supplied source release tag
2. **Source-Side Sync Gate** — Skips downstream publish when the plugin-published source surface did not change since the previous release tag
3. **Clone Repos** — Clones BOTH source and published repos
4. **Build Plugins** — Runs `scripts/Build-Plugins.ps1` which:
     - Copies canonical plugin templates from `.github/plugins/`
     - Strips committed `.exe`/`.dll` runtime payloads so the published repo stays wrapper/bootstrap-only
     - Updates `plugin.json` version and `version.txt`
     - Preserves plugin-local `bin/` wrapper/download assets and runtime-bootstrap metadata
     - Synchronizes complete skill directories from source (`skills/powerpoint-mcp`, `skills/powerpoint-cli`), removing stale published files
     - Stamps the release-tag version into each packaged skill's generated `VERSION` file
     - Validates Agent Plugins 1.0 manifests, portable `mcp.json`, and Agent Skills frontmatter
5. **Migrate Marketplace Layout** — Rewrites the published repo into the canonical marketplace layout by applying the source-owned root overlay, writing `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`, and removing any legacy root `marketplace.json`
6. **Published-Repo Guards** — Rejects downgrade or tag/version mismatch publishes before mutating the published repo
7. **Sync to Published Repo** — Only commits and pushes when the guarded sync path says publication is needed
8. **Create or Repair Tag** — Tags the published repo with the same version (for example `v1.2.3`) when the tag is missing
9. **Summary** — Generates workflow summary with the publish/skip decision and GitHub Copilot CLI install examples for changed published artifacts

### Version Extraction Strategy

**Corrected:** Uses `workflow_run.head_sha` plus the checked-out git tag graph to find the annotated source release tag created by the release workflow.

- ✅ Avoids race condition: Uses the exact commit that was just released
- ✅ No drift: If multiple releases happen close together, each publish uses the correct version
- ❌ Old (incorrect) approach: "latest release" could grab the wrong version in rapid succession

### Sync Gate

- The hardened source-side flow skips downstream plugin publication when the install-surface inputs have not changed since the prior release tag.
- Result: normal releases still publish all core artifacts, but plugin republishing only happens when plugin-facing content actually changed.

### Version and Tag Guards

- Published-side sync rejects downgrade attempts.
- Manual repair/replay runs must keep the requested tag/version aligned with the incoming plugin manifest/version metadata.
- The sync step now rewrites the published repo to the canonical marketplace layout on every needed publish, so legacy root-manifest state is repaired automatically.
- Result: maintainers can re-sync safely without accidentally stamping the wrong release tag onto plugin artifacts.

### Concurrency Control
- Only one publish workflow runs at a time
- Does NOT cancel in-progress runs (waits for completion)
- Prevents race conditions during concurrent releases

### Idempotency
- Automatic release-follow-on runs skip entirely when no plugin-published source files changed since the previous release tag
- Automatic duplicate publishes are skipped when the published repo already has the same version and tag
- Manual re-sync runs can replay an existing release tag without cutting a new source release
- If the published repo is already in sync, the workflow exits with a clear summary instead of making an empty commit

---

## Testing the Workflow

### Test After Token Setup

1. **Trigger a test release** (or wait for next real release):
   ```powershell
   # From source repo, trigger a release manually
   gh workflow run release.yml -f version_bump=patch
   ```

2. **Monitor the publish workflow**:
   ```powershell
   # Watch for publish-plugins workflow to start
   gh run watch

   # Or list recent runs
   gh run list --workflow=publish-plugins.yml
   ```

3. **Verify published repo updated**:
     ```powershell
     cd ../mcp-server-powerpoint-plugins
     git pull
     git log -1  # Should see the latest publish commit
     git tag     # Should see new version tag
     Test-Path .github\plugin\marketplace.json  # Should be True after migration
     ```

### Manual Re-Sync

If the automatic follow-on publish needs to be replayed after a transient failure, use the workflow's manual `workflow_dispatch` entry point with an existing source release tag:

```powershell
gh workflow run publish-plugins.yml -f release_tag=v1.2.3
```

Keep the requested release tag aligned with the plugin manifest/version the workflow is syncing; the published-side guards reject mismatched or downgrade attempts.

### Troubleshooting

**Workflow fails with "Resource not accessible":**
- Token does not have write access to `sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint-plugins`
- Token is expired or revoked
- Check that `PLUGINS_REPO_TOKEN` secret exists in the source repo

**Workflow fails immediately with a missing configuration message:**
- Add repository secret `PLUGINS_REPO_TOKEN` in `sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint`
- Verify the secret contains a valid PAT or app token with write access to the published repo
- Rotate PAT if it has expired or been compromised

**Workflow completes but no commit in published repo:**
- The source-side sync gate detected no plugin-published source changes since the prior release tag
- OR: The published repo already had the same version and tag, so the automatic duplicate publish was skipped
- OR: Build-Plugins.ps1 generated identical content and the published repo stayed in sync without a new commit

**Workflow fails with a version/tag guard message:**
- Confirm the requested `release_tag` exists in the source repo and matches the plugin manifest/version being synced
- Check `.github/plugin/marketplace.json` (or the legacy root `marketplace.json` if the published repo has not been migrated yet) and existing tags in `sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint-plugins`
- Downgrade attempts and inconsistent "tag exists but version differs" states are intentionally blocked

**Build step fails:**
- Build-Plugins.ps1 requires .NET 10.0 SDK
- `Build-Plugins.ps1` requires an explicit `-Version`; source skill directories do not carry fallback `VERSION` files

## Maintenance and updates

### Updating plugins and published output

The source repository is the only editable source for plugin publication. The
published repository is generated output: unsynchronized hand edits in
`sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint-plugins` are prohibited and can be overwritten by the
next publication.

For every plugin change:

1. Change the canonical source first under `.github/plugins/`, `skills/`, or the
   owning build, sync, and workflow files in `sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint`.
2. Build or regenerate the plugin packages with `scripts/Build-Plugins.ps1`.
3. Run `scripts/Sync-PublishedPluginRepo.ps1` against a clean checkout of
   `sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint-plugins` to produce the complete publication tree.
4. Inspect the generated diff and run the focused generation, sync, instruction,
   and plugin validation, including the generated repository's
   `tests/Test-Plugins.ps1`. Fix failures in the source repository, regenerate,
   and repeat; do not patch the generated output.
5. Only after the generated diff and tests are clean should the source pull
   request be merged and the release publication path be allowed to run.

Merging a source pull request alone does **not** publish plugins. A normal
successful `Release All Components` run on `main` triggers
`publish-plugins.yml`. Maintainers can also run `publish-plugins.yml` manually
with an existing source release tag to re-sync or repair publication. The
workflow directly commits and pushes the generated output to
`sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint-plugins/main`.

### Changing Published Repo Name

If you rename `mcp-server-powerpoint-plugins`:
1. Update `PUBLISHED_REPO` env var in `publish-plugins.yml`
2. Rotate or update `PLUGINS_REPO_TOKEN` secret if needed
3. Update the published-repo metadata owned here (for example `.github/plugins/marketplace-repo/README.md`) so the next sync rewrites the target repo correctly

### Debugging Build Issues

Run the build + sync scripts locally to test:
```powershell
# From source repo root
./scripts/Build-Plugins.ps1 -Version 1.2.3
./scripts/Sync-PublishedPluginRepo.ps1 -PublishedRepoDir ..\mcp-server-powerpoint-plugins -BuiltPluginsDir .\plugins -Version 1.2.3

# Verify output
ls plugins/
ls plugins/powerpoint-mcp/
ls plugins/powerpoint-cli/
Test-Path ..\mcp-server-powerpoint-plugins\.github\plugin\marketplace.json
```

## Architecture Notes

### Why workflow_run?

The workflow uses `workflow_run` trigger with `head_sha` version extraction:
- ✅ **Avoids binary race condition** — Waits for release workflow to complete, ensuring GitHub Release artifacts exist
- ✅ **Atomic trigger** — One publish per release, no manual intervention
- ✅ **Version alignment** — Extracts tag from the exact commit that was just released (not "latest release")
- ✅ **No drift** — If multiple releases happen close together, each gets the correct version

**Version extraction logic:**
```yaml
HEAD_SHA="${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}"
git fetch --force --tags origin
TAG=$(git tag --points-at "$HEAD_SHA" --sort=-version:refname | grep -E '^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+([-.][0-9A-Za-z.-]+)?$' | head -n1)
```

### Why source-owned canonical templates?

**Build-Plugins.ps1 strategy:** copy complete source-owned plugin templates, then inject release metadata and current skills.

- ✅ **Single source of truth** — manifests, MCP configuration, READMEs, and bootstrap scripts live in this repo
- ✅ **Prevents legacy feedback** — published artifacts are never reused as build inputs
- ✅ **Schema-safe output** — build and publish guards reject legacy fields and `.mcp.json`
- ✅ **Build script's job** — copy templates, inject version/current skills, validate, and package

**What gets copied:**
- Plugin structure → From `.github/plugins/powerpoint-mcp` and `.github/plugins/powerpoint-cli`
- Skills and all references → Exact directory sync from source repo `skills/powerpoint-mcp` and `skills/powerpoint-cli`
- Marketplace repository README → From `.github/plugins/marketplace-repo`
- Marketplace manifest → Generated by `Sync-PublishedPluginRepo.ps1` at `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`
- Runtime bootstrap metadata → `version.txt` + plugin-local helper scripts in `bin/`

**What gets updated:**
- `plugin.json` version field
- `version.txt` (release-tag metadata consumed by plugin-local bootstrap logic)

### Runtime Bootstrap Packaging Rules

- Published plugins ship **wrapper/download logic and metadata only**.
- Self-contained Windows runtimes stay in the main repo GitHub Releases and are fetched by the plugin on first invocation.
- Each release publishes `SHA256SUMS` in GNU-style `<hash>  <filename>` format for both Windows runtime ZIPs. Bootstrap downloads and cached archives must match the exact asset entry before extraction.
- `publish-plugins.yml` now validates that built plugin artifacts do **not** contain committed `.exe`, `.dll`, `.deps.json`, or `.runtimeconfig.json` payloads.
- MCP configuration is portable root `mcp.json` with explicit transport type and `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` arguments; legacy `.mcp.json` is rejected.
- Standard skills stay under `skills/`; any future Copilot-only files belong under `com.github.copilot/`.

### Why two repos?

**Source repo** (`mcp-server-powerpoint`):
- Development, testing, releases
- CI/CD, integration tests, documentation
- Binary build outputs (MCP Server, CLI)

**Published repo** (`mcp-server-powerpoint-plugins`):
- Distribution only (lightweight marketplace)
- Canonical Copilot CLI marketplace manifest lives at `.github/plugin/marketplace.json`
- No build dependencies (just JSON, Markdown, PowerShell scripts)
- Clean separation: users don't clone 200MB source repo to get plugins

### Why not git submodules?

The published repo is NOT a submodule of the source repo. Instead:
- Workflow pushes built artifacts directly to published repo
- Published repo is standalone (easier for users to clone/fork)
- No submodule complexity for plugin consumers
- Allows published repo to have different README, docs, structure

## Success Criteria

✅ **Workflow created:** `.github/workflows/publish-plugins.yml`
✅ **Build script created:** `scripts/Build-Plugins.ps1`
✅ **Documentation created:** This file
⚠️ **Token configuration required:** User must add repository secret `PLUGINS_REPO_TOKEN`
⚠️ **First run test required:** Validate after next release

---

**Status:** Implementation complete, pending token setup and first-run validation
**Next Steps:** User must configure repository secret `PLUGINS_REPO_TOKEN` in `sbroenne/mcp-server-powerpoint`, then validate both the automatic release-follow-on path and the manual `workflow_dispatch` re-sync path. The next successful sync will also migrate the published repo to the canonical marketplace manifest path/layout.
